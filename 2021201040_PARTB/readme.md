Assumptions-

I have zipped all the html,css,js and images into a folder.

I have made a simple SERC website using HTML,CSS and JavsaScript along with JQueries.

I have added the about and all the fields according in the nav bar in all the pages. Whenever we click on certain option, it leads to another HTML page. For students and faculty , I have only shown two faculty and two students details in seperate pages.

For News/Updates, I have added some random images in the slideshow in home page. 

For twitter I have used embed twitter tool to show the tweets dynamically.

For publications, I have read the xml file through url from DBLP website of two of the faculty members only and i have printed all their publications along with the year and title.

For admin mode, I have added the implementation of admin mode to the about.html page and to all the people pages, which can be added to other pages as well in the same way. We can change only the paragraph content in the admin mode. The changes are only visible until the page is refreshed. 

For contact and resources ,I have simply made most of them as static pages with no content, just to show it on the screen.

I have written some inline css, and internal CSS and Internal JS files for some particular html pages.

Also I have added only the samples for most of them because we can add others in the same way.
