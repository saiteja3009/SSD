->I have added th eprint statements wherever the input is taken/required which clearly mentions what all can be expected as input.

->Intially, total no. of items, then input for each item with item id, half/full plate which is denoted using (1/2) respectively, followed by the quantity of the particular item.

->Then we need to send the tip percentage which can be either 0/10/20 as mentioned in the requirements.

->Then the total no of people should be given as the input.
