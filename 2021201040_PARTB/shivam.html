            <h2>About</h2>
            <p id="cs">Shivam Khandelwal is dual degree CSD student under the guidance of Prof. Raghu Reddy. He is working primarily in Gamification and Empirical Research in Software Engineering Domain. Gamification in layman terms is the usage of Game Design Elements (GDE) like badges, leaderboard, votes, etc to other product or services in order to keep users retained, engaged and motivated. This essentially means none of “actual” working of the product is affected but overall re-represented to users as kind-of games. His work is around a framework which potentially allows developers to gamify their codebase within minutes, just like adding Google Analytics. Other then this the empirical work is around learning how gamification can impact behavioural changes under competition v/s non-competitive environment. If you wanna join the work, the technologies used in depth are Ember.js (similar to Angular.js), Flask and anything of your wish. :) And just in case you don’t like the idea of Gamification, there is one more topic i.e. “Systematic Literature Surveys”. Systematic reviews are a type of literature review that uses systematic methods to collect secondary data, critically appraise research studies, and synthesize studies. The work is around making them automated to reduce manual labour of 1000s of researchers. Along with it, making it cake walk for novices to jump in a new research field.</p>
